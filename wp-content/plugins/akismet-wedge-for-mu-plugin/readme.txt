Globalizes the akismet api key so it can be used across blogs.

== Description ==
The Akismet Wedge for MU Plugin wedges between MU Blogs and Akismet providing the Akismet key and other data. MU blogs will be able to use the Akismet API key without having to configure each blog or edit any PHP files.

Note: the plugin must load before Akismet and most of the time this is not a problem. If you see the Akismet configuration warning on a blog dashboard, don't worry. The blog will still use Akismet correctly.

== Installation ==
1. Download the plugin.
2. Upload the plugin to your wp-content/plugins directory.
3. Activate the plugin. There are no options to set.
